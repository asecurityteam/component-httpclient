## Overview

**Deprecation Notice:** This package will be archived and made read-only on January 30th, 2024. After January 30th this repo will cease to be maintained on Github.

This is a [`settings`](https://github.com/asecurityteam/settings) that enables
constructing a smart HTTP client from a
[`transportd`](https://github.com/asecurityteam/settings) configuration. The
purpose of this component is to enable Go projects using `transportd` as a proxy
to statically link the proxy behavior with the Go application. We use this,
for example, to run our code in serverless environments where additional
functionality cannot be run as a separate process.

## Quick Start

```golang
package main

import (
    "context"
    "net/http"

    httpclient "github.com/asecurityteam/component-httpclient"
    "github.com/asecurityteam/settings"
)

func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()
    envSource := settings.NewEnvSource(os.Environ())

    tr := httpclient.New(ctx, envSource)

    c := &http.Client{
        Transport: tr,
    }
}
```
